    /*
     The biggest problem with StreamIO, is we need to provide a interface for both files and packets.

     I mean, isn't that the entire god damn point of BufferIO? that it can be used to piece files into chunks, and load multiple packets into chunks as well?

     it's the entire god damn point...

     So we're ok there...

     All we really need is the infrastructure to say where a file or network input or output is in relation to BufferIO, and have this interface be maintained by the buffer it's self.

     So, modify FileIO and NetworkIO to have BufferIO control them; they're downstream from BufferIO; BufferIO is in charge.

     ----

     Is there a lower level interface for dealing with files on POSIX or in C?

     Fuck a big ass FILE pointer with it's associated buffers and all kinds of stupid shit.

     Ok, yes you can use the `open()` function, it's a part of POSIX, and is available on windows; returns a file descriptor aka an integer.

     FLACNative streams can only support FLAC encoded audio.
